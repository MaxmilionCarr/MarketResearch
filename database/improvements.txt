1.) Could make get_create use get_info and create functions rather than redoing everything. This change is reflected in equitiesrepo
2.) Make all data base methods have no error handling, will be done by a fetch function to remove redundant and repetitive code
3.) Add extra info functions for tables with more info
4.) Ensure type checking using MyPy -> Ensures non wacky numbers or strings when pulling api data
5.) Check unique constraints on schemas
6.) Historical prices should be seperated into distinct time types (Daily data, Hourly Data, 5 Minute Data) -> Allows for testing of different timescale trading strategies (Issues come from cost / throttling might be a job for AWS with an automated autostart every maintaince shutoff)
